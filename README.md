# Triangle-test-with-pytest

Simple tests using pytest and pytest-watch

The triangle.py file contains the triangle() function, which returns True if with given sides length 'a', 'b', and 'c' the triangle can be made.
Otherwise it returns False.

You can try this out using pytest-watch, which runs all the test functions after saving changes to the files.

First you need to install the pytest library if you don't have it installed. You can do this using the command: 'pip install pytest'

Second, you can install pytest-watch using the following command: 'pip install pytest-watch'

Then you can open a terminal for example in Pycharm environment and type 'ptw' to run pytest-watch.
